In order to run flint you will need at least the following:

1. Install python, django, flup and virtualenv.

2. Create a path for django projects and virtualenv's. The default is 
   /var/django and /var/django/.virtualenvs respectively.

3. Install your code in /var/django/MYPROJECT

4. Then simply run flint

$ sudo flint start MYPROJECT

That will start a FastCGI daemon with a UNIX domain socket located at 
/var/run/django/MYPROJECT-fastcgi.sock
